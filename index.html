<h2>My First Blog</h2>
<p>I'm very excited to put this into practice and looking at how my tutor is taking me through, i have no doubt of completing the course. With determination and purpose i will see to it that this becomes a reality and not just a fiction.
    Though, there are bigger challenges in the coding world i'm aware and ready for it. Life after html is no joke for i know there's a heavier Javascript, a mightier php or phyton programming language awaiting. In all, man is ready and poised to take the responsibilty.
    <br>
    <br>
    Neverthless, in all these i am looking forward to be succesful in developing a pleasing website and encouraging web applications after the class. With my tutor's display i see it achievable.
